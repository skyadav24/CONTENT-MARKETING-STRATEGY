--As part of my digital marketing internship, I was assigned to develop a content marketing strategy for a brand. This task involved identifying the brandâ€™s target audience, understanding their preferences, and crafting engaging content to meet their needs. I conducted research to determine the most effective blog topics, social media trends, and promotional channels to enhance brand visibility. The strategy also included a detailed content plan outlining the frequency, format, and platforms for publishing content. By aligning the strategy with business objectives, I aimed to increase audience engagement and brand awareness. The final deliverable was a comprehensive content marketing plan document that can be used for execution.
